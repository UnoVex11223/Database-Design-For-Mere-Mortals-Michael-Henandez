# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python: Notes & Solutions üêç

This repository contains my personal notes, chapter summaries, and solutions to the exercises from the book **"Data Structures & Algorithms in Python"** by Goodrich, Tamassia, and Goldwasser.



This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the design, analysis, and implementation of data structures using modern, object-oriented Python.
