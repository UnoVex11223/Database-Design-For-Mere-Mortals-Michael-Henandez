# Chapter 5: Establishing the Mission & Objectives

The first step in the database design process is to define the project's purpose and scope. This involves interviewing users to gather requirements and then consolidating those findings into a clear mission statement and a set of objectives.

## Conducting Effective User Interviews üó£Ô∏è

Interviews are the primary method for gathering information about the data requirements. To ensure they are productive, it's crucial to establish clear participation guidelines.

### Interview Guidelines

* **Set Clear Intentions**: Before you begin, make sure all participants understand the purpose of the interview. Explain what the new database project is about and what you hope to learn from their expertise. This builds trust and ensures everyone is focused on the same goal.

* **Foster Cooperation**: Let the participants know that their time and input are valued. They are the subject-matter experts. Create an open, non-judgmental environment where they feel comfortable sharing details about their processes, including any current frustrations or inefficiencies.

* **Act as the Official Arbitrator**: When interviewing groups, disagreements about business processes or rules may arise. It is your job to act as a **neutral facilitator**. Listen to all perspectives, guide the discussion, and help the group reach a consensus on how the process should work in the *new* system. Your role is to understand and document, not to take sides.

* **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Avoid simple "yes" or "no" questions. Instead of "Do you track customer phone numbers?", ask "What customer information do you typically need to record?". This encourages more detailed and complete answers.

## Defining the Mission Statement üéØ

The mission statement is a brief, clear declaration of the database's purpose. It acts as the "guiding star" for the entire design project, ensuring that every decision aligns with the core goal.

### Characteristics of a Good Mission Statement

A well-crafted mission statement is:

* **Clear and to the Point**: It should be written in plain language, free of technical jargon or business buzzwords. Anyone, from a developer to an executive, should be able to understand it instantly.
* **Concise**: It is typically one or two sentences long.
* **A Statement of Purpose**: It defines *what* the database is for, not *how* it will be built. It is completely platform-independent.

### Example

* **Weak Statement**: "To architect a cutting-edge, synergistic data warehouse solution leveraging cloud technology to optimize our customer relationship management and sales-channel workflows."
    * *(This is vague and full of jargon.)*

* **Strong Statement**: "To maintain a central record of all customer information, track all sales transactions, and provide a complete history of customer interactions."
    * *(This is clear, direct, and defines a specific, measurable purpose.)*
