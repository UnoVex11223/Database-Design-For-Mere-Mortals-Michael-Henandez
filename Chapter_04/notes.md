# The Seven-Step Database Design Process

This document outlines a structured, seven-step methodology for designing a robust and efficient relational database. Following these steps ensures that the final product is well-planned, meets user needs, and maintains a high level of data integrity.

***

### 1. Define the Mission Statement & Objectives 
This initial step establishes the **purpose** and **focus** of the database.

* **Mission Statement**: A brief, clear statement on the purpose of the database. (e.g., "To manage customer orders and track inventory.")
* **Mission Objectives**: A list of the general tasks and goals that users will be able to accomplish. (e.g., "Users can enter new customer information," "Users can view order history for any customer.") This helps to set a clear direction for the design.

***

### 2. Analyze the Current Database 
If a database already exists, you must analyze it to understand current processes and identify areas for improvement.

* **Review the Legacy System**: Examine the existing database structure and how the organization currently uses its data.
* **Conduct User Interviews**: Talk to the people who use the database daily to understand their workflows, pain points, and needs.
* **Compile a Field List**: Create a comprehensive list of all data fields currently in use. During this process, identify and separate any **calculated fields**, as these should not be stored directly in the new database but generated by queries instead.

***

### 3. Create the Data Structures 
This is the core architectural phase where you build the foundation of the database.

* **Define Tables and Fields**: Group the compiled fields into logical, single-subject tables.
* **Establish Keys**: Assign a **Primary Key** to each table to uniquely identify every record. Identify and assign **Foreign Keys** that will be used to link tables.
* **Define Field Specifications**: For every field, determine its properties, such as data type, length, constraints, and whether it's a required field.

***

### 4. Establish Table Relationships 
With the tables defined, you now formally establish how they relate to one another.

* **Conduct Further Interviews**: Talk to users to confirm how different subjects (tables) are connected (e.g., "How does a customer relate to an order?").
* **Identify Relationship Types**: Determine if the relationships are one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.
* **Establish Relationship-Level Integrity**: Enforce rules like referential integrity to ensure that, for example, an order cannot exist without a valid customer.

***

### 5. Define Business Rules 
Business rules are real-world constraints that must be applied to the data to ensure it remains valid and accurate.

* **Conduct More Interviews**: Work with users and stakeholders to identify all the rules and limitations that govern their operations (e.g., "A customer's credit limit cannot exceed $5,000," "An order date cannot be in the future.").
* **Establish and Implement Rules**: Translate these rules into database constraints, application logic, or by using **validation tables** to limit the acceptable values for a field.

***

### 6. Define Views 
Views are virtual tables that provide customized perspectives of the data for different user groups.

* **Interview, Interview, Interview**: Determine the various ways that different users or user groups need to see and interact with the data.
* **Establish Views**: Create the necessary views to simplify complex queries, combine data from multiple tables, and restrict access to sensitive information.

***

### 7. Review Data Integrity 
This final step is a comprehensive quality check of the entire database structure.

* **Final Review**: Meticulously review every table, field, key, relationship, and business rule.
* **Ensure Integrity**: Confirm that the design effectively enforces data integrity at all levels (table, field, and relationship), ensuring the data will remain accurate, consistent, and reliable.
